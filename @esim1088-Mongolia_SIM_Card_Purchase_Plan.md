First things first, letâ€™s talk about the types of SIM cards available.

But wait, thereâ€™s more! For those who need a bit more flexibility and speed, we also offer high-speed internet SIM cards.

Our high-speed plans come with generous data allowances and are designed to keep you online even in remote areas. Plus, theyâ€™re super easy to activateâ€”you just need an active internet connection to set them up.

Another exciting option is the eSIMs we provide. An eSIM is a digital SIM that allows you to download a SIM profile directly onto your compatible smartphone or tablet. This means no more physical SIM cards to lose or swap out! With our eSIMs, you can enjoy the same great connectivity options as a physical SIM but with added convenience. And guess what? You can switch between different plans whenever you want, giving you ultimate control over your data usage.

Now, letâ€™s talk pricing. Our Mongolia SIM card plans are competitively priced to suit every budget.
