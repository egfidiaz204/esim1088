Each type serves a different purpose, so itâ€™s important to choose the one that best fits your needs.

Phone cards are great for those who need to make calls and send texts but donâ€™t require heavy data usage.

For travelers who need to check emails or browse the web occasionally, a phone card might be just enough.

If youâ€™re someone who relies heavily on mobile data, a data SIM card is your best bet.
